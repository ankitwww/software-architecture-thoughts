   <summary> My introduction</summary>

I started writing code after my senior high school. I learned `C`, `C++`, `GW-Basic` (and even Pascal and Fortran). After starting my full-time job, I worked as a `.NET` programmer for a couple of years. In 2015, when I started my own start-up along with my college folks, I started playing with `JavaScript`, `Azure`, and `Node.js`. Although later I focused more on product management than the actual coding - I was actively managing the overall software design.
In early 2020 (just before COVID), I moved to Vancouver (left the startup a few months earlier) and later switched back to a full-time developer job.
Presently I am working as a senior developer/architect in a large enterprise environment.
This repo is based on my own learnings, observations, and re-skilling over the past few months. A few folks might find it useful - but the majority of people won't find this repo consistent as per their own taste and competency. This imperfection is "by design" as every developer is different.
